# Introduction to Islandora

This presentation was developed for a mixed audience, which included people who had never done digital collections work before right up to those who knew and had worked with Islandora. The goal was to provide exactly the right balance of information about Islandora to keep both parties engaged. In no way does this presentation purport to be comprehensive about Islandora.
